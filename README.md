## 1. Introduction
SQL Injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. It is one of the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities found in web applications. Exploiting SQL Injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, and even complete control over the database server. As such, understanding and mitigating SQL Injection is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of web applications.

## 2. Project Overview
This project involves creating a web application using Flask and MySQL to demonstrate the SQL Injection vulnerability. The project covers both the exploitation of this vulnerability and the implementation of strategies to prevent such attacks. Through this project, we aim to highlight the importance of secure coding practices and provide practical solutions to safeguard against SQL Injection, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of web applications.

## 3. SQL Injection Attack Analysis

### What is SQL Injection?
SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is able to insert or "inject" a malicious SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL Injection attack can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data, execute administrative operations on the database, and more.

This vulnerability arises due to improper handling of user input, allowing attackers to manipulate SQL queries. Additionally, SQL Injection can be used to bypass authentication, impersonate users, and potentially escalate privileges, making it a critical security issue to address.

### Example of SQL Injection 
Consider the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '$email' AND password = '$password';
